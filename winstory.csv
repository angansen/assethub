Currently they employ the commonly used Power School information management system to collect and store their student information. Unfortunately, this system is not customizable and does not meet the state reporting requirements. As such, they need a easy system to pull information and reporting to meet the state and federal mandates that does not require a heavy IT lift.

The reps used a twoN/Apronged approach to engaging the client.

1)Leveraged the new Exadata Cloud Machine pricing
2)Stressed the all-inclusive OCPU that included all database options
3)Structured an annual commit consumption model
4)Secured approval for an effective 8 year contract
","One of the first lessons learned with Energy Transfer is existing SPARC customers represent both an opportunity and a risk. Proactively talking with SPARC customers that are looking to the future is critical. Another lesson learned is account teams shouldn’t be afraid to “go outside the box” when it comes to constructing terms, conditions and contracts that meet customer needs. Finally, the team learned that it’s important to understand DAS and CPQ process details in order to work through roadblocks and unique contract requirements."

","Started the process 30 months ago, but Altec was not ready to move to OCI.  We continued to stay engaged at both the executive and technical level with Altec.

We did a full conversion of SPARC to Linux and executed a successful POC which included a in depth sizing exercise to learn Altec’s environment.  The next step was to determine who would be their “run and maintain” partner.  At this point we began engaging with IBM who was the incumbent for run and maintain.

Through that engagement, the account team established working relationships with the Enterprise Architecture team, who was very adamant that they have an AWS mandate.

Nav learned about Naveego’s focus on scaling in those discussions, which proved to be invaluable. The Oracle team evaluated their AWS bill using projected growth figures. Showing Naveego where they could expect to save money with OCI today and in the future was game-changing.

Business Requirement to move workloads to the Cloud
Upgrade current Exadata platforms
","This opportunity happened quickly. The initial discussions started in November 2019, we presented the overall solution to the customer on January 8th, 2020, and customer purchased on Feb 28th . Amgen was interested in consolidation of database technologies onto a high performance platform. They had old Exadata’s and were going to refresh, and we showed them a path to an on-premise cloud solution that allowed them to create savings, increase performance and scale as required.","
If you can, do the CSA or Full MSA as early in the sales process as you can.  Amgen would not even start the discussions until they fully agreed to moving forward, which was on Friday, Feb 14, 2020.  The Complex deal team, Tier 1 and Legal were able to respond to redline MSA with Schedule C, S and P over the weekend of Feb 22nd .  Legal and Amgen Legal completed the full negotiation with Amgen in 5 days.   It was awesome to see!
Keep moving things forward, there will always be obstacle.  However, Oracle wants to do business with customers, and we will figure out a way to find a way to have both Oracle and the customer win.    Always lots of pressure coming from lots of places, just keep the customer and Oracle moving forward.

The customer was looking to migrate 80 Oracle DB’s to Open Source PostgresQL. It was thought that it would be cheaper than to migrate these DB to Oracle Cloud. 
         
","This customer acquired some ExaCC in 2018 (Gen1) and went through a very long and painful activation process and a lot of issues with the services after activation. In October 2019, customer made it clear to Oracle that if these issues were not addressed they would go away from ExaCC to another solution.  Many teams at Oracle were involved to help reestablish the relationship and a reliable service. OCS was involved in the migration of DB to ExaCC Gen1 from 2019 and kept their dedication to make this a success all through the difficult time. OCS, led by Aaron Millstone and Frank Crusing was also involved in the new services offering that was part of the deal and  by offering the customer an assessment of the project and program to see how we could jointly accelerate the migration of more than a hundred DB to the ExaCC (Gen1 and Gen2).","1. Ensuring the message back to the customer was aligned with the objectives
2. Leveraging the execs around you at Oracle can help you ensure the proper narrative even if all they do is repeat exactly what you have been saying
3. You cannot over communicate on a new complex solution, through repeated sessions and workshops 
4. Ensure everyone understands the narrative (at Oracle and at the customer) this will make sure the contracts and legal happy on both sides
5. Complex deals like this do not end with the order booking, a lot of effort are required right after booking to ensure we get back to the business objectives (now that legal is addressed) and the sales rep leadership is even more required at this stage

","Uber initially asked how they could backup Oracle apps and databases to AWS.  The sales team used that as a way to challenge the customer to investigate a solution on Oracle Cloud.  Regular education sessions and discussions enabled Uber to learn about the price/performance and functionality advantages Oracle offers.
","We can win against Amazon.  Our price/performance value proposition is compelling.  Hybrid deals that involve cloud, on-prem, OCS, Oracle University and ACS provide competitive differentiation.
