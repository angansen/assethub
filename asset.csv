“When choosing  a data warehouse solution”

think about a holistic data platform that can best support your organizational needs now and in the future
framework to evaluate solutions.


Based on my experience, here are the top 4 factors:

(1)       ROI:
Integrating with existing applications and related platforms seamlessly and extending them further

(2)       Flexible:
Ability to ingest and analyze all-data types from multiple sources

(3)       Secure:
Securing data with advanced features

(4)       Future Proof: Productized/Simplified  advanced analytics and AI/ML with ease



DATA PLATFORM

How is integrated data & analytics platform helping you manage your day to day operations better?



<Ease of setup – automated templates to kick-off. Reduce human labor to reduce human error; quicker analytics and ability to share data with both functional and IT teams effectively. >



Ingest
Data sources – SaaS Apps, Oracle Data Cloud, Point of Sale, various data lakes and storage systems (Oracle or otherwise)
Real Time and Batch
Analyze
Scalable APIs
Cloud Analytics
Low-Code Dev
Embedded ML
Spatial & Graph
Act
Applications
Digital Assistants
Augmented Analytics for decision making
Integrated Analytics with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Productized ML in OAC and ADW to bring out data insights faster to right users at the right time on ALL the data, while other data warehouses use sampledata out of various ML frameworks. Other data warehouses are following Oracle’s Embedded ML strategy, and are at least a decade behind in features.
Low-code development with solutions like Application Express (APEX)
Out-of-the-box integration with Oracle Analytics Cloud to deliver the industry’s most comprehensive analytics in the cloud.
Enterprise Integration – reduces Complexity with an extensive library of pre-built connectors to SaaS, on-premises systems, & 3rd party applications
Data Integration – Real-time and Batch
SECURITY

  How has the built in and additional security features provide additional protection to the data?

<Encryption at rest, in motion, data marking, external threat detection and remediation, etc. >

Other security measures are taken as well, like logging and monitoring all admin activity for unauthorized access, hardening of the OS and DB, and encrypting data everywhere. Privileges are managed across cloud and on-premises, and there are pre-built policies and templates for point-and-click setup.
Data Safe: In addition to ADW built-in security, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers Oracle Data Safe.  Oracle Data Safe is a fully-integrated Cloud service focused on the security of your data. It provides a complete and integrated set of features for protecting sensitive and regulated data in Oracle Cloud databases. Features include Security Assessment, User Assessment, Data Discovery, Data Masking, and Activity Auditing.

White Paper,WP Test,"Oracle’s Cloud Data Platform Autonomous-Driven & AI-Infused Workshop







This workshop will walk you through the process of using the Autonomous Data Warehouse for storing analytical datasets and applying Machine Learning models in order to learn the correlation between different attributes and predict the future demand while leveraging Application Express to create a simple application as well as link to a 3rd party web app. These features will also be integrated through the bonus use of a chatbot that you can interact with using natural language.



You will take on 2 Personas during the workshop. The Data Scientist Persona will prepare the data for training and validating the machine learning models and apply those models in order to predict the future demand. The Business Analyst Persona will also build and apply Machine Learning models using Oracle Analytics Cloud service without writing a single line of code. During the workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Machine Learning tool (OML), Oracle Analytics Cloud Service (OAC), Oracle Application Express (APEX), Oracle Rest Data Service (ORDS), and the Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) chatbot.



•Lab 100: Getting Started: Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Application Express (APEX) – 30 minutes
•Lab 200: Use Oracle Machine Learning (OML) to Run a Machine Learning Model and SQL Developer to Grant User Privileges – 30 Minutes

**DATA PLATFORM**

How is integrated data & analytics platform helping you manage your day to day operations better?

<Ease of setup – automated templates to kick-off. Reduce human labor to reduce human error; quicker analytics and ability to share data with both functional and IT teams effectively. >


* Ingest
	* Data sources – SaaS Apps, Oracle Data Cloud, Point of Sale, various data lakes and storage systems (Oracle or otherwise)
	* Real Time and Batch
* Analyze
	* Scalable APIs
	* Cloud Analytics
	* Low-Code Dev
	* Embedded ML
	* Spatial & Graph
* Act
	* Applications
	* Digital Assistants
	* Augmented Analytics for decision making

**Integrated Analytics with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**

* Productized ML in OAC and ADW to bring out data insights faster to right users at the right time on ALL the data, while other data warehouses use sampledata out of various ML frameworks. Other data warehouses are following Oracle’s Embedded ML strategy, and are at least a decade behind in features.
* Low-code development with solutions like Application Express (APEX)
* Out-of-the-box integration with Oracle Analytics Cloud to deliver the industry’s most comprehensive analytics in the cloud.
* Enterprise Integration – reduces Complexity with an extensive library of pre-built connectors to SaaS, on-premises systems, & 3rd party applications
* Data Integration – Real-time and Batch

**SECURITY**

  How has the built in and additional security features provide additional protection to the data?

<Encryption at rest, in motion, data marking, external threat detection and remediation, etc. >

* Other security measures are taken as well, like logging and monitoring all admin activity for unauthorized access, hardening of the OS and DB, and encrypting data everywhere. Privileges are managed across cloud and on-premises, and there are pre-built policies and templates for point-and-click setup.
* Data Safe: In addition to ADW built-in security, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers Oracle Data Safe.  Oracle Data Safe is a fully-integrated Cloud service focused on the security of your data. It provides a complete and integrated set of features for protecting sensitive and regulated data in Oracle Cloud databases. Features include Security Assessment, User Assessment, Data Discovery, Data Masking, and Activity Auditing.
* Availability (99.95%) – 4 hours of downtime a year
* Auto applies security patches and upgrades with complete tenant & data isolation
