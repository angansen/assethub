Moreover, a lot of the resources for these data centers support the customers EBS and OBIEE environment. And in fact, there is a mandate throughout the company to reduce capital expenditures by $1 billion in the next few years. As a result, executives in Western Digital are looking to transition from a Capex model to Opex model and reallocate manN/Ahour resources to more valueN/Aadded activities and less maintenance/operational ones.""
","Analysis and Implementation:
We proposed ADWC as a highly elastic, scalable solution that provisions a data warehouse environment in just a couple of seconds, be ready to load data in minutes, and easily connect to OAC, Western Digitals analytics platform for the longN/Aterm future. Phase 1 of the project would be a oneN/Ayear POC Pilot to test capability, security and performance in sandbox environments. Phase 2 would be to expand their ADWC environment and roll it out after 4Q19.

They found themselves paying for under utilized resources 36 instances, with many not doing anything. In addition, Treasury as a whole put out cloud first initiatives, and ultimately, HR Connect needed to implement SLAs  for its 22 entities (aka customers) that it could potentially lose.","HR Connect has been in motion since Summer of 2017. Eboni Harris, the OD Cloud Rep, had an introductory call with a DBA of HR Connect Program Office (HRC). On the call, she learned of the programs increased interest in a cloud platform. He mentioned there were talks, but no decision or assessment. Following that call, Eboni spoke with the Development Manager. She and her SE Navdeep Mahajan provided him with cloud information and pushed for a cloud trial for further learning. For weeks to follow, she sent the team cloud events and information to keep their interest and education them on Oracles offerings.","Finding the right person at the right time.

It does not have a county infrastructure to rely upon for shared services. As such, its schools are resource constrained. It must still comply with the state and federal reporting mandates for its schools. Specifically, it must report on student achievement and demographics. Currently they employ the commonly used Power School information management system to collect and store their student information. Unfortunately, this system is not customizable and does not meet the state reporting requirements. As such, they need a easy system to pull information and reporting to meet the state and federal mandates that does not require a heavy IT lift.
","Took a sales play of reporting for school systems and ran a campaign against every school system whether existing customer or not. Discovered Manassas City Public Schools wanted enhanced reporting off of their SIS  This deal started as an Analytics Cloud deal with reporting. There overall strategy was to go to cloud and to have a centralized data warehouse for the school  When Autonomous became available, it was natural fit for this small city of 40,000. Autonomous could be deployed quickly. Additionally because of the limited IT resources, it needed to be as turnkey as possible for the LOB to produce the necessary reports. ","Always tell the whole business intelligence story. The LOB leaders care about the outcomes and reporting, not the IT. IT wasnt involved in this deal. ADW is a natural fit when selling analytics at any time. It does not require IT resources to manage.

WS-69tk02pxj5c,Louisville Water begins their foray into cloud with ADW and OACS,Louisville Water,null,280,Kapstone,null,null,null,joe.desantis@oracle.com,"Louisville Water as using Discoverer, Oracles BI product which reached end of life Q1FY19. As such, Joe set up a call to discuss the way forward on Oracles new technologies. Simultaneously, Bobby Tolleson was talking with Louisville on the future of cloud for their operations, specifically, Oracle Cloud. A long time Oracle customer, Louisville prides itself in staying current with new Oracle technologies. The question for them was how to make the changes with the least amount of disruption to their operations as possible. With the endN/AofN/Alife for Discoverer, the time seemed right to look at cloud options for at least that part of the business.
","""Although the reps engaged on two separate paths with the customer, the analysis of the situation lead to the paths converging. The endN/AofN/Alife for Discoverer led to deeper conversations on Oracles cloud solutions; where Oracles R&D was being focused; and how Oracle could help them eventually meet their long term strategic goals of reducing custom applications and moving to SaaS. The reps used a twoN/Apronged approach to engaging the client. First, the team demoed OAC and ADW to the end users (business users) comparing the functionality and enhancements of the new technology to what they had been using. Then on the tech side, the team demoed the functionality, but also talked about the investment in the technology; the cost benefit over an OnN/Aprem solution; and the roadmap for the products. In addition to the cloud based BI solution that would allow for reporting on their EBS data (OACS with ADW), the team proposed a sandbox to test a migration of EBS starting with test/dev and DR. Once EBS is stabilized on OCI, the roadmap for migrating each of the modules to the SaaS solution can begin. 

This implementation not only solved the product endN/AofN/Alife problem, but has provided Louisville Water with a proposed roadmap for their longN/Aterm modernization goals. In addition to modernizing their reporting and subsequent data environment, they are able to balance the move to new technology without disrupting operations, thereby increasing  efficiencies.""
","End-of-life products can provide great inN/Aroads for discussions with customers. This customer, while mulling over moving to cloud, was faced with a definitive decision point. It made sense to make the move now. Additionally, cloud deals are great initiators. They start small, but as consumption grows, so does the account. Once youve developed that relationship in the account, the customer will continue to find new and innovative ways to use the technology.

The endN/AofN/Alife for Discoverer led to deeper conversations on Oracle’s cloud solutions; where Oracle’s R&D was being focused; and how Oracle could help them eventually meet their long term strategic goals of reducing custom applications and moving to SaaS. The reps used a twoN/Apronged approach to engaging the client. First, the team demoed OAC and ADW to the end users (business users) comparing the functionality and enhancements of the new technology to what they had been using. Then on the tech side, the team demoed the functionality, but also talked about the investment in the technology; the cost benefit over an OnN/Aprem solution; and the roadmap for the products. In addition to the cloud based BI solution that would allow for reporting on their EBS data (OACS with ADW), the team proposed a sandbox to test a migration of EBS starting with test/dev and DR. Once EBS is stabilized on OCI, the roadmap for migrating each of the modules to the SaaS solution can begin. 

This implementation not only solved the product endN/AofN/Alife problem, but has provided Louisville Water with a proposed roadmap for their longN/Aterm modernization goals. In addition to modernizing their reporting and subsequent data environment, they are able to balance the move to new technology without disrupting operations, thereby increasing  efficiencies.","Autonomous Data Warehouse; Create New Data Marts

WS-4sak7qmgk0c,GAP: move workloads to IaaS & PaaS,GAP,null,18000000,Microsoft - Oracle partnered with Microsoft (this deal established the first interconnect built between the OCI and Azure Clouds).,null,null,null,"Sandra.Cox@oracle.com, Maurits.Blok@oracle.com, Sabrina.Andara@oracle.com","The initial business challenge: Divestiture of Old Navy with Old Navy to be ‘born in the cloud’. When the divestiture was called off, Gap’s new business challenge was to utilize the teams in place working the divestiture and switch gears to now focus on moving Gap Inc to the Cloud. The specific business challenge was how to do this with the budget for the divestiture no longer available. Gap needs to be out of the data centers in the next year and needs to save money. By moving  to the Cloud, Gap will save costs given the decommissioning of Gap’s data centers and be on the path to modernize in an ever competing retail market.
","1.	Numerous meetings with Gap, Microsoft and Accenture to review what will move to OCI and what will move to Azure. This went back and forth for months given the many challenges around VMWare and PCF Support on OCI and other. 
2.	Cloud and Architectural Design reviews and application and database disposition decisions made. 
3.	Discussions on consumption - meetings with customer and internal to bring more clarity and agreement on annual consumption levels. 
4.	DAS worked and continually updated through the negotiation phase. Several complex requests that required the Complex Deals Team involvement and HQAPP approvals. 
5.	Pricing and discount level BOM models were requested by Gap.  BYOL and License Included scenarios were created.
6.	Executive Summary’s to justify Oracle's recommended consumption ramp forecast
7.	Business case / incentives with clarity detail for 3 option scenarios. 
8.	Several meetings with Gap Sourcing and CIO to review proposal.
9.	Once agreement was made on deal sizing, OD completed and presented. 
10.	Quick turnaround to Close for Q3 as Oracle would not extend ‘offer’ beyond Q3.","Lesson learned is that anything can happen even at the very end when you think all is done and agreed to. In this case, we had the final OD in hand when Gap announced that the divestiture (and therefore our deal) was no longer taking place. The account team had to regroup and determine our next course of action to keep a deal on the table.  

By working closely and communicating daily, we were able to anticipate what the customer would request  and work accordingly to get ahead of it. We were never flat footed.

Because this deal morphed so many times (out of our control) we couldn’t avoid repeating many of the same steps multiple times, particularly when it came to formulating our proposal. This was frustrating to the team but unavoidable and ultimately enabled us to close the deal on time in Q3.

As Phenix requires a global presence along with consistent exceptional customer service (reaction time to SRs, problems that may come up, etc) Sales approached them with a plan which Phenix vetted and ultimately accepted.
","As this was an existing Cloud customer Sales approached the new CEO that was hired in Oct 2019 with plans for expansion. After learning his vision for Phenix and his idea of the ideal vendor/deal, Sales positioned the expansion and terms. The deal was negotiated for ~2 weeks which was then executed on Dec 23, 2019."," This sales cycle was definitely one to learn from as the total negotiation cycle was less than 2 weeks. It caused Oracle to act with a sense of urgency and ultimately led to one of the largest deals to date in SMB this FY. There are very few things I would change and nothing major, however I would repeat the consistent sit downs with the C level executives in future accounts, the hands on knowledge of the technology the customer delivers and how OCI can supplement that, and finally, how our prices/services directly effect the customer’s bottom line. This account has a huge support team designated to Phenix’s success as the onboard larger and larger customers. The OCI engineering team, CSM, NetOps and DevOps teams have been integral in this deal and have been engaged with this account since day one.

","Started the process 30 months ago, but Altec was not ready to move to OCI.  We continued to stay engaged at both the executive and technical level with Altec.  In July of 2019 the customer agreed let us prove out OCI via a POC.  We engaged the Oracle IaaS and Application Development team to help the ECA team with the POC.  We did a full conversion of SPARC to Linux and executed a successful POC which included a in depth sizing exercise to learn Altec’s environment.  The next step was to determine who would be their “run and maintain” partner.  At this point we began engaging with IBM who was the incumbent for run and maintain.

They were open to exploring options to enable the org’s digital modernization agenda by moving PSFT to a public cloud provider.  On-premise deployment in  the DXC datacenter was limiting Gore’s ability to rapidly adopt new technologies.
","The Oracle Account team had previously engaged with WL Gore to secure a cloud win for an ETL opportunity. Through that engagement, the account team established working relationships with the Enterprise Architecture team, who was very adamant that they have an AWS mandate.  Relationships established led to the sharing of the HR LoB’s intention to move PSFT to public cloud (AWS being the default per the mandate). The account team engaged with DXC team directly.  Through strong partnering, the Oracle account team and DXC were able to demonstrate the OCI price & performance advantages of moving an Oracle workload to OCI. The Oracle team leveraged DXC’s long standing relationship with Gore’s HR leadership and with a strong economic proposal favoring OCI, Oracle and DXC were able to convince Gore to forgo a POC.  Oracle engaged in the sales cycle for 4 months showing the compelling economic advantages of OCI over the competition. This accelerated commercial negotiations, and the streamlining of the procurement process.  
","Establishing Win/Win with partners who have long histories with our clients is crucial.  This deal would likely have gone to AWS if Oracle and DXC team had not collaborated effectively, creating a win/win scenario for all parties involved in the transaction.  Oracle secured the OCI deal.  DXC grows their MSP deal by 30% in adding OCI into the agreement.  WL Gore gains better price & performance by partnering with Oracle Cloud and DXC.

When Nav and his team first reached out, Naveego was already showing some interest in Oracle Cloud. They were entrenched with Amazon Web Services but questioned whether it would be their best option moving forward with their plans for aggressive growth. 
When Nav sat down to discuss a potential relationship, he didn’t start by touting OCI’s cost-savings, feeling that would’ve been too assumptive. Instead he focused on understanding Naveego’s current and future business challenges.

Nav learned about Naveego’s focus on scaling in those discussions, which proved to be invaluable. The Oracle team evaluated their AWS bill using projected growth figures. Showing Naveego where they could expect to save money with OCI today and in the future was game-changing.
 
","Whenever we needed an executive to get on a call, it happened.

","In order to prevent a pivot to AWS, we knew that protecting the OCI tenancies was critical.  Our best way to defend against loss of the subscription was to lock in a long-term renewal.  However, the EBS ERP environment was not up for renewal until May 30, 2020.  Since time was our enemy in this situation, we devised a plan to encourage Doosan Bobcat to commit to an early renewal – thus blocking a threat of migration to AWS.  Upon analysis, it became clear that Doosan’s total OCI spend qualified them for an improved rate card discount.  In exchange for an early renewal, Doosan received a modest discount and a right sizing of the commit to match their consumption.  Month over month consumption was approximately 80% of monthly commitment.
","The sales team created a sense of urgency by reinforcing a firm offer expiration date.  In addition, we developed and presented convincing TCO reduction proofs.  Lastly, building and maintaining trusted relationships with IT leadership and purchasing stakeholders who were tasked with comparing the OCI and AWS business cases enabled us to close the deal in late-December, 2019.

Informatica did not have an effective orchestration framework/model in place to handle their IT support workloads all around the globe and the resolution time use to take weeks especially in follow the sun model. Significant time and resources were spent in insignificant tasks like patching/upgrades etc. and in 2019 they experienced security breaches related to customer infotmation. Their training platform used to run on Oracle Ravello which was End of Life’d and they were evaluating alternate technologies.

","The sales process was going on for almost a year. Oracle consulting services and the Oracle solution Hub’s were instrumental in helping the customer with multiple POC’s to gauge price/performance around the 3 areas:
•	Lift and shift of on-prem global support IT and ticketing apps running on Oracle DB to DBCS
•	Non-critical internal Training workloads on Apex and ADW
•	Docker Kubernetes for issue resolution
Additionally, the solution hubs had to develop a custom portal using APEX and ADW to publish their support and training workloads. As this custom application did not have a proper support model, we engaged OCS to provided Day 2 services to ensure clean migration and go-live within the critical timelines.
","•	Engage early. Definitely show the value of OCI through POC’s. We always provide consistent performance compared to AWS/Azure.
•	Train the operations users and the cost of management giving a better ROI.
•	CFO is the key for strategic projects and we need his blessing early in the cycle.
•	Leverage solution hubs and consulting.

We also did a great job of getting buy-in from the customer and having an internal champion that could help fight for us when the customer's processes hit roadblocks.

Amgen was interested in consolidation of database technologies onto a high performance platform. They had old Exadata’s and were going to refresh, and we showed them a path to an on-premise cloud solution that allowed them to create savings, increase performance and scale as required.","
If you can, do the CSA or Full MSA as early in the sales process as you can.  Amgen would not even start the discussions until they fully agreed to moving forward, which was on Friday, Feb 14, 2020.

They ultimately selected Autonomous Transaction Processing due to lower price, TCO, and the Oracle-managed backend.","The customer committed to a $60K annual commit for one year. This deal was the first Autonomous deal with Bank of New York Mellon, and we will use this to strategically increase Autonomous usage within the finance and other LOBs. We are starting workshops to increase Autonomous usage. Additionally, this is a pre-cursor to an OAC opportunity, as a goal for the customer is to extend their analytics capabilities from their ERP, so we will start having OAC conversations. The ultimate goal here is Exadata cloud at customer, and then have them continue using Autonomous.

VG has a number of vendors across the ERP footprint.  This includes WD for HR, Zucius for Procurement and PS for Financials. This creates a burden for IT to maintain all the integration points.  There has been significant turnover at VG so there is limited in-house knowledge for the PS platform. VG will need to invest heavily in PS over the next 18 months to manage the PUM process as well as additional integrations.  In 2018 Vanguard contracted PCMCS which is the first Oracle Cloud application for Vanguard Finance.  The implementation went extremely well and created positive relationships with Vanguard Management
","In June 2019 a new CPR aligned with Vanguard (VG) and began to unpack and understand the VG business as well as history and presents between both orgs. The Oracle CPR began to drive on direct alignment to relationships at Exec layer(CTO of Cloud) out to the newly formed CG Cloud strategy team led by CTO.  Based on this work the CPR team aligned with the Vanguard Fin group leading the PS to ERP/EPM strategy.  The CPR then reached out to Oracle ASM to align on driving the PaaS side of things to ensure success.  In Sept 2019 VG began a paid for ERP/EPM trial($40K) for three months(extended to 6mo) Because the CPR team had already developed their own VG relationships it was natural to align a PaaS Trail(SE led from Hub) to help with advanced Integration(OIC), migration(ADW) and security(IDCS) requirements of the project. The Trial needed to be extended and the ASM/CPR teams managed for 6 months to basically help build out dev environments while final BOMs and commercials finally came to close in May 2020.  CPR team is now working an OAX opp for Q1 FY21. Shout out to a Strong CSM(Zach Matthews), Hub resources(Mike Terra/David Huffman) & ECA(Brett Lovelidge) as this was the team that held together the technical execution over a 6+mo PaaS DEV/Trial cycle while we finalized the BOM and commercials.  

","The Combined team necessary to win PaaS for SaaS(CSM, HUB, ECA, CPR) along with tight alignment with ASM team.
Building your own customer relationship and finding path with ASM team is a must. 
A hub led SE Trial was a great way to manage this experience with VG and at the end we converted to 5yr UCM with potential expansion expected with in the first year because of other use cases now in view.

This approach has many benefits, including improved decision making, reduction of errors through automation, and ability to better manage risk and optimize assets. FICO's EBS was sitting on old hardware. EBS was the last mission critical application in FICO's data center.
","This sales process involved the help of the entire Oracle pre-sales arsenal. Mark Weber worked directly with the leadership within the customer to develop a future state and BOM. Mark worked continuously to refine the architecture and BOM to the requirements of the customer. The Oracle Cloud Solution Hub team helped to execute a POC running EBS on OCI. The final stage of the sales process was a comparison between AWS, which OCI was the clear winner.
","The entire Oracle pre-sales team worked extensively to prove out running EBS on OCI. The Oracle team ran a 60 day POC environment that helped convince FICO's decision makers OCI was the only way to go. Utilizing the POC effectively, combined with an iron-clad business case, the Oracle team was able to prove the value of the solution while keeping any potential competition out.

The solution that was decided on included running the application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Oracle Linux for his three Virtual Machines (Production, Analysis, and Development), Oracle’s Object Storage with a NAS and storage gateway for storing files, and Oracle Autonomous Database as the backend database.

This was a project that needed to be done yesterday, according to upper management. ","Prior to our first meeting with the customer, we knew they were analyzing three options: (1) .Net, (2) Forms and Reports 12c, and (3) doing nothing. We introduced them to two more options: APEX on-premise and APEX on ATP. The customer had specific criteria to make a decision: cost, license comparison, and conversion cost and time. Once understanding that, we had to sell the customer on APEX. We brought in David Peake who presented the ins and outs of APEX for two hours. After this conversation, it came down to a decision of on-premise vs. Cloud. Ultimately, the cost of Cloud along with the Consulting team resources that would help Del Monte onboard and learn the new technology made it clear that APEX on ATP was the right solution for them. The customer committed to $12k ARR for one year, plus 40 hours of Consulting to migrate their Forms 6i to APEX on ATP.

Business Challenge : JASCI is growing at an exponential rate, landing multiple customers per week. The company’s previous infrastructure, IBM Cloud, was unable to scale on demand, resulting in severe bottlenecking and management headaches.","Partner Overview: Mythics is an award winning Oacle systems integrator, consulting firm, managed services provider.

Mythics delivers technology solutions serving the Federal Government, State and Local Governments, Commercial Higher Education and Research,

Utilities and Healthcare sectors and is a trusted partner to organizations worldwide.

 

Solution : In need of a highly-available solution capable of handling extreme throughput, the customer was quickly sold on the benefits of Exadata. When the topic of data management was presented, however, it became evident that an additional service was required. The CEO was adamant that he wanted to eliminate as many backend tasks as possible, which made his company the ideal candidate for Autonomous Transaction Processing.

They were interested in using GoldenGate to replicate the entire SAP schema to the data warehouse to reduce the load on the source SAP database and improve efficiency of the team and speed of delivery to the data warehouse.","Director of Global IT was seeking a quote for GoldenGate on-premise licenses – their current environment was on-premise, and they were more familiar with these tools. The Cloud team fought for a discovery call and learned that OFS moves data to their data warehouse and then distributes the data to a mix of cloud and on-premise applications, such as Salesforce, a demand planning application, scheduling systems, and some custom C# and .NET applications. Many of these processes were convoluted, and they needed guidance on creating a simpler future state. We proposed a future state architecture with ADW as the data warehouse, redistributing data to their BI tool and other applications with GoldenGate and ODI in the cloud.  We took advantage of the promotion for free GoldenGate and ODI on OCI Marketplace to ultimately win the deal. Customer agreed to a $12K ARR deal for UCC with substantial room for growth as they add more data sources. A deal like this would typically have a much longer sales cycle, but the customer committed to get the deal done in May, recognizing the efforts of our team. This is OFS Fitel’s first Oracle Cloud deal and happened very rapidly, so we are working to familiarize the customer with our Cloud interface and establish a connection between their on-premise database and new data warehouse.

We’re moving a lot of their custom apps running on Oracle database to OCI 

Improve Performance For Enterprise Applications – $70B of business run through their EBS environment and performance has been a key issue for their back-office applications.  By moving EBS to OCI, FedEx can leverage the performance of Oracle’s engineered system in Exadata and leverage PaaS for integration both for on prem and cloud

Business Intelligence – The growing amount of siloed data at FedEx has been a challenge to be able to integrate cross data sources and perform key financial analysis.  There’s been a need to create a true data platform and build an analytics engine on top that can deliver accurate and meaningful information.  
","Cloud Consumption Analysis – We conducted bi-weekly health checks with FedEx on how they’ve been consuming on OCI which was a very important exercise to be able to understand their past and current usage of cloud.  This then drove the discussion towards future needs analysis and planning.  FedEx has under consumed in their 1st year of using OCI and we were determined to understand the ‘why’ and ensure moving forward that we drive towards full consumption. 

Drive Engagement Activity – The sales team including ECA and Hub Engineers made it a mission to meet with different LOBs across FedEx to drive the value of OCI through various series and combination of webinars, roadshows, workshops, CVC and executive presentations.  

CVC – We held a 2-day CVC with FedEx finance in HQ in order to discuss the value of OCI and the benefits that we can deliver by modernizing their EBS back office application.  This was a very important step to get FedEx leadership by in for doing a POC on OCI

Business Cases – The Oracle Business Value team built two key business cases for FedEx.  The first was prove the business benefits of moving EBS to OCI for finance.   We built a second business case for FedEx CDAS to prove out the benefits of moving PeopleSoft to OCI.  Both of these use cases were included as part of the scope in expanding the FedEx UCC contract

Proof Of Concepts – The ECA, Sales Team, and ACS collaborated and worked on a very successful POC to prove out the performance benefits of running EBS on OCI.  We had to transfer over 100TB of data using Fast Connect onto OCI in order to conduce the POC.  We also conducted a second POC with the FedEx CDAS group in testing OCI for their PeopleSoft HR Payroll application.  

Cloud Consumption Growth Planning – The sales team and ECA team met with different operating companies under FedEx to understand their current and future needs on cloud and determine their overall demand on OCI.  By identifying all of their projects we were able to build a plan for each of their projects including BOMs and ultimately consolidated the messaging with FedEx finance to deliver the full scope of their demand across FedEx.  

Contracts And Negotiation – Sales leadership and their sponsorship as well as the help of our approvers and contracts team was key in getting the buy in from FedEx to move forward with the expansion and extension of their UCC contract.  The result was a May FY21 deal which was $40mil of new revenue to Oracle.  
","Planning And Execution:  The sales team continuously planned and put a strategy together that we all agreed on to execute.  It was important we stayed together as a team and trust the strategy we put in place that ultimately drove the result of this win. That included having an account plan and a close plan.   

Leverage All Resources:  We all need to continue and leverage every resource we have at Oracle to win large deals like FedEx. 

Win Your Customer’s Trust:  Our work in cloud does not end when FedEx signed the contract.  The work only begins so it’s important to stay engaged, create a consumption plan with FedEx and drive continuous activity.  This helped to build trust and helped in driving the additional investment FedEx made on OCI.

 Flexibility:  This deal took many unexpected twists and turns.  The team constantly went in with a plan only to dynamically adjust, change tactics and reposition their strategy.  The deal literally was booked with a travel company during a global pandemic.  If the team were not able to change, and do so quickly, this deal probably would not have closed.

Bart, however, made sure not to stop here and leveraged the deep expertise of the OCI Product Management team to help drive this deal.  In fact, they are hosting another OCI workshop in May for several of HighJump’s divisions globally to highlight how OCI helped implementation times from 2-3 months to 2-3 days. 
 
 Flexibility:  Bart understood where HighJump was coming from and worked with his partner to find a solution that was mutually beneficial.

 "," Jon asked for the opportunity to educate Workforce on OCI and met with Workforce’s VP of Cloud Services.  Workforce quickly became interested in conducting a POC.  Workforce also was willing to share their 20,000 lineitemed Azure bill for the preceding three months.  With the help of Bob Robinson, the sales team found that OCI was 67% less expensive (at standard OCI pricing).  The team did the same analysis on Workforce’s co-location facilities, and discovered OCI was still 30% cheaper. 
 
Workforce wanted to verify these findings as part of their POC.  Following successful completion of the POC, and solely based on OCI’s price-performance merits, Workforce’s VP of Cloud Services wanted to sign a multi-million dollar ARR deal in Q2.  Right before approving the contract, though, Workforce’s CEO became interested in exploring potential GTM collaboration with Oracle.  After extensive discussions involving Safra Katz, Dave Profozich, Doug Kehring and Oracle HCM Product Management, Workforce leveraged the Accelerate Framework and signed a much larger, longerterm deal. 
 ","Well-Executed Sales Process:  The team leveraged an internal champion at Workforce to get a meeting with key Workforce decision makers, where they positioned and then quantified the advantages of running on OCI.  The team then proved these advantages with a successful POC, and subsequently positioned Accelerate after further qualifying Workforce’s interest in GTM.  
 
 Partner-Focused Engagement: Oracle’s consultative-approach was a key differentiator here. The team was laser-focused on joint success, positioned Oracle as a partner whose solutions empowered Workforce, patiently educated them on OCI, and dynamically adjusted to the customer’s needs. Workforce was particularly delighted to hear that Oracle would host daily migration calls post-engagement and stay heavily engaged post-sale.   
 
 Cross-Functional Collaboration: To close this deal, Jon and team leveraged the expertise of numerous individuals across the Oracle ISV Ecosystem org, and in different product line organizations, such as HCM.  In addition, after the sale there has been considerable upselling with the team tapping domain experts in Oracle Management Cloud, Oracle Analytics Cloud, Oracle integration and chat bots to explore new potential deals with Workforce.

He also noticed that RecVue were consistently out-spending their budget on OCI-Classic and saw a great opportunity to migrate RecVue to Oracle Gen 2 Infrastructure (OCI).  With enhanced priceperformance on OCI and a rapidly-expanding portfolio of platform services, Chris knew that RecVue could do much more for a lower price on our Gen 2 Infrastructure."," To prove this, Chris analyzed RecVue’s spending patterns and calculated the base-rate savings possible under a new contract for OCI.  Next, he selected platform services, such as Autonomous Database, newly available on Gen 2 that aligned with RecVue’s business growth needs. What followed was a sequence of thoughtful, data-driven conversations with RecVue leadership, which eventually persuaded RecVue to commit to Oracle Cloud for multiple years.  Importantly, Chris obtained the necessary approvals to allow for a 120 day migration period and a 30% discount on the rate card.  
 
 ","Quantifying Results: After analyzing customer usage and cross-referencing RecVue’s business needs, Chris created spreadsheets quantifying how much could be saved if RecVue switched to OCI Gen 2 and expanded their consumption. While some assumptions were needed, and Chris had to be resourceful in knowing Oracle’s offerings and where internal discount breaks were, these datadriven models formed the deal’s bedrock.  
 
 Customer Education: An important driver in increasing the deal value was educating RecVue on what they can do with us, and the flexibility they have on Oracle.  It was through this process that RecVue were introduced to, and are now trialing, Autonomous Database and other services. 
 
 Trust & Partnership Building:  The net result of Chris’ proactivity, data-driven analysis and customer education was deep trust and an incredibly strong partnership.  RecVue knew that Chris had their best interests at heart and that Oracle was more than willing to work with them.

Building on the momentum from this meeting, Josh arranged Oracle and Cybereason executives – including their Chief Revenue and Chief Customer Officers – to meet at OpenWorld 2019.   

Leveraging the ISV Accelerate framework, and highlighting GTM opportunities unmatched by Cybereason’s other public cloud providers (AWS and GCP), the Oracle team persuaded Cybereason’s leadership to evaluate OCI. The team then arranged a subsequent meeting between Safra Catz and Cybereason’s CEO, Lior Div. 

After the CEOs connected, the technical enablement process moved ahead.  This stage was made challenging by the fact that some of Cybereason’s technical teams had reservations about running on OCI.  Apprehensions, however, were dispelled in late January when six members of the Oracle technical team flew to Tel Aviv to host a series of in-depth technical workshops
","- Many teams, one Oracle: Big deals are complex and require an entire team engaging with the partner.  To get this deal closed, Josh successfully worked with the OCI Product Management team, Oracle  IT, as well as the ISV Ecosystem Sales Consulting, ISV Business Development and Marketing teams.  Critical support also came from Oracle Legal, Rev Rec and many others.   
 
- Strong organization: Some of the complexity encountered in this deal simply came from coordinating across multiple Oracle teams… some of which were not used to working together.  However, resources were managed well and deadlines consistently met due to the account team’s excellent organization, diligence and coordination.   
 
- Perseverance: This deal cycle was 20 months from end to end.  Josh never let the fact that Cybereason were heavily invested in AWS, and had also decided to move significant workloads to GCP, deter him in his pursuit.  He strategically targeted the right teams within Cybereason, and though they kept changing, he was eventually able to raise the level of his engagement in the account. Josh’s perseverance and consistent execution powered this deal.

 Executive Sponsorship:  Without strong leadership buy-in on the partner’s side, the deal might not have happened.  In fact, Vertex were quite far along with their migration to AWS when Oracle took the bull by the horns.   
 
 Selling All of Oracle: A big component of the deal was selling the entirety of Oracle Cloud and the integration with our SaaS portfolio.  Autonomous Database featured here too.  The team demonstrated what Oracle Cloud services and capabilities could mean for every aspect of Vertex’s business.  The “hook” wasn’t just OCI, but rather Oracle. 
 
 Partnership as investment:  Kevin and Joe reframed the discussion from “cutting costs” to jointly investing and driving net new business.  This consistent repositioning of the partnership fundamentally changed how Vertex viewed Oracle.

Middle of February,  this project pivoted quickly to addressing payment from Governments/NGO’s as part of all the Covid Reflief State, Local, NonProfits were securing.  MC saw the issues of having trouble getting money into the hands of citizens quick and securely,  problem they wanted to solve.  We first partnered with Mastercard for the City of LA, partnering with John Sasson of the S&L CX team.  John’s team’s ability to stand up a CX solution quickly was a big help in convincing MasterCard that we were the right partner to go to market in developing this Disbursement Solution.

Not only was this critical in garnering internal support and breaking down barriers within Xactly, it also made them immediately feel like a truly valued partner.

The accounts team with the help of Product Managers and solution engineers conducted series of meetings with the IT Team and interview with the business to understand the technical issues and problems experiencing by the users. 

After the meetings, we identified the solutions that can resolve issues and presented a plan to the customer on how we could provide them a much better performance with lesser disruption to the business compared to moving to Microsoft. 

","My advice is with this kind of project, the sales team should engage OCS on the early stage of sales cycle. 
You should have an open and honest communication with the customers especially the decision makers. 
It helps in managing the expectation and cuts the unnecessary objections once the proposal is presented.
